I have included the 64 bit version of the vglclient and the vglconnect script.
You most likely want to install the most current version.

On Archlinux it is:
pacman -S virtualgl

Included:
vglclient: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=d76765417569dfcd1cfa7b7077729c9d9db3e7ca, stripped
vglconnect: POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable
